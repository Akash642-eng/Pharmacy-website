# 🏥 Maruti Pharmacy Management System

A modern, modular **Flask-based web application** designed to manage pharmacy operations efficiently.  
The project emphasizes **clean backend architecture**, **domain-driven separation**, and **production-ready design practices** aligned with real-world engineering standards.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Pharmacy systems demand accuracy, security, and scalability.  
This application implements a **pharmacy management platform** that handles authentication, product management, cart workflows, order processing, and payment abstraction using a well-structured Flask architecture.

The focus is on building a backend system that goes beyond basic CRUD operations and reflects professional backend development practices.
